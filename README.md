#TASK DESCRIPTION

Pipelining is a feature in RISC processors that allows for multiple instructions over-lapped in execution and to be executed during one clock cycle. During this task, I used verilog-HDL to design a 16-Bit RISC processor that is able to execute 15 instructions, each at one clock cycle. These instructions include add, subtract and load in the instruction memory. The processor features an Instruction memory, Data memory, General Purpose Registers, ALU, ALU control unit, RISC control unit, and datapaths connected using pipelines.
